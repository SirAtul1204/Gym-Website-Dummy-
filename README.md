# Description

It's a dummy multipage website created by create-react-app to showcase my web devlopment skills.

This website shows general inforamtion for a gym and a form to buy its membership, I haven't implemented the payment setup as I don't want someone to pay mistakely.

On successful submission of the form, the data will be saved at a MongoDB database (with unique Phone Number and Email) also the applicant will get a unique QR code in his/her email. The website make API calls to backend server (also created by me https://github.com/SirAtul1204/Gym-Website-Dummy-Backend) and a mailer created by node-mailer (https://github.com/SirAtul1204/Mailer-JavaScript)
